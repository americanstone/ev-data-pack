This dataset is recorded from a Skoda Enyaq EV.

You can replicate this using a CANedge and the included Configuration File. 

To process and decode the data, you can e.g. use the CANedge Python API / dashboard integration. 

This folder contains dashboard templates that can be used for the 'CANedge InfluxDB Writer' integration.

NOTE: This config/DBC should support more-or-less all VW/Skoda electric cars. In particular, this includes:
- VW ID.3, ID.4, ID.5
- Skoda Enyaq
- Audi e-tron

The DBC was based on the work from below repository:
